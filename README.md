# 501_Reflective-Object-Serialization


The program should be run and compiled on intellij IDE, and Their is two program should be run, first is reciver which will create socket of local host, then run Sender it will have proper text gui to guide how to use it.
The displaying does not use the code form assignment 3, instead of that, the progarm will serialize the object that just deserialized. Notice that the id of any object is different, because i used the hashcode to generate the id.
Since eventhough that they have the same value but the hashcode will consider the memory location, which prove that i did deserialized then serialized again.
